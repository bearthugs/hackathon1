1. In your terminal, type in:
    python -m venv virtual_env
        OR  
    python3 -m venve virtual_env
Try python first. If it doesn't work, use python3.
DO NOT run both.

2. Then, type in:
    source virtual_env/bin/activate
This actually lets you now use the virtual
environment you just created

3. Next, while you're IN THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT:
    pip install Flask
Obviously, this installs Flask.
Okay, you're good to go, good luck
